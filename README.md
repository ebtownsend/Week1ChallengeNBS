# Week1ChallengeNBS
Week 1 Challenge for NBS QA Training (Elle Townsend)
---

> Notes - User stories time estimations in story points. Numbers used to represent an approcimation of complexity and time needed to complete (e.g. 1 = <1 day, 2 = 1 day, 3 = 2 days, 5 = 3 days, 8 = 4 days, 10 = 1 week).

## What Was The Challenge?

To create user stories for a cinema booking system project, with accociated acceptance criteria, defininitions of done, and time estimations. Essentially creating a product backlog for a cinema booking website project.

## How Did I Expect The Challenge To Go?

I expected the challenge to test my ability to apply agile methodoloies to take on the role of product owner and give me the chance to apply my knowledge of how product backlogs are created.

## What Went Well?

I found it easy to come up with stories and group them into epics to encapsulate the functionalities described in the task.

## What Didn't Go Well?

I got worked up in thinking too much about potential for requirements and due to the 'vaugeness' of the prompt, it meant that the scope of the project was unclear and I was unsure of how much detail to go into in terms of functionalities and user stories for those required functionalities. This meant that although I had planned everything out, I had a lot of user stories that I deemed necessary for the task that I spent a lot of time writing acceptance criteria for.

## Improvements For The Future

Have a finite, structured scope for the project to prevent getting too involved with trying to write user stories to meet vague criteria points.
